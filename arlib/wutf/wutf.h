// It is well known that Windows supports two flavors of every function that
//  takes or returns strings(*): A and W. The A ones take strings in the local
//  user's codepage; W uses UTF-16.
//  (*) With a few exceptions, for example CommandLineToArgvW, CharNextExA and GetProcAddress.
// It is also fairly well known that the local codepage can not be set to UTF-8,
//  despite users' repeated requests.
// It is less well known that the A functions convert their arguments and then
//  call the W functions.
// It is even less well known (though easy to guess) that there are only a few
//  conversion functions in the entire Windows.
//
// It is not very well known that you can mark memory executable using
//  VirtualProtect, and use that to create your own functions.
// It is even less well known that you can mark existing functions writable.
//
// Combining those lead to an evil idea: What if we replace the A->W conversion
//  function with an UTF8->UTF16 converter?
// And this is exactly what I did.
//
//Limitations:
//- IMMEDIATELY VOIDS YOUR WARRANTY
//- Possibly makes antivirus software panic.
//- Will crash if this code is in a DLL that's unloaded, possibly including program shutdown.
//- Affects the entire process; don't do it unless you know the process wants it this way.
//   I believe most processes actually wants it this way; everything I've seen either expects ASCII
//    only, uses the W APIs, or is console output (which is another codepage). I am not aware of
//    anything that actually expects the ANSI codepage.
//- Disables support for non-UTF8 code pages in MultiByteToWideChar and WideCharToMultiByte and
//    treats them as UTF-8, even if explicitly requested otherwise.
//- Console input and output remains ANSI. Consoles are very strangely implemented in Windows;
//    judging by struct CHAR_INFO in WriteConsoleOutput's arguments, the consoles don't support
//    UTF-16, but only UCS-2. (The rest of WuTF supports non-BMP characters, of course.)
//   A more technical explanation: The most common ways to write to the console (the ones in msvcrt)
//    end up in _write, then WriteFile. I can't replace either of them; I need to call them, and
//    there's no reasonably sane and reliable way to redirect a function while retaining the ability
//    to use the original.
//   _setmode(_O_U8TEXT) doesn't help; it makes puts() convert from UTF-16 to UTF-8. I need the
//    other direction.
//   SetConsoleOutputCP(CP_UTF8) seems more promising, but it reports success and does nothing on
//    Windows XP and 7. I'm not sure what it actually does.
//- CharNextA/etc are unchanged and still expect the ANSI code page. (Does anything ever use them?)
//- SetFileApisToOEM is untested. I don't know if it's ignored or if it actually does set them to
//    OEM. Either way, the fix is easy: don't use it.
//- Actually uses WTF-8 <https://simonsapin.github.io/wtf-8/>; you may see the surrogate characters
//    if you somehow get invalid UTF-16 (it's fairly permissive on UTF8->16, too; it accepts CESU-8)
//- Windows filenames are limited to ~260 characters; but I believe functions that return filenames
//    will count the UTF-8 bytes. (The ones taking filename inputs should work up to 260 UTF-16
//    codepoints.)
//- According to Larry Osterman <https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/larryosterman/2007/03/20/other-fun-things-to-do-with-the-endpointvolume-interfaces/>,
//    "all new APIs are unicode only" (aka UTF-16).
//- The UTF8/16 converter is not identical to MultiByteToWideChar(CP_UTF8):
//  - While it does support UTF-16 surrogate pairs, it's perfectly happy to encode lone surrogate
//    characters, as per WTF-8 <https://simonsapin.github.io/wtf-8/>. MBtWC rejects them.
//  - It supports decoding lone surrogates, too - or even paired surrogates (also known as CESU-8).
//  - If given invalid input (and MB_ERR_INVALID_CHARS is absent), it emits one or more U+FFFD
//    REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, rather than dropping them or creating question marks.
//   It does reject overlong encodings, and processes surrogate pairs correctly.
//- Did I mention it voids your warranty?
