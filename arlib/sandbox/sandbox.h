#ifdef ARLIB_SANDBOX
//Allows safely executing untrusted code.
//
//Exact rules:
// If the child process is running hostile code, the parent may deadlock or _exit(), but may not crash or use an invalid handle.
// Failing an access check in the child yields undefined behavior (subject to the above, of course).
// It can return EACCES, kill the process, or whatever.
//
//WARNING: There is NO SECURITY WHATSOEVER on Windows. A "sandboxed" process can do anything the parent can.
//Windows provides plenty of ways to restrict a process, but
//- Most of them are blacklists, disabling a particular privilege; I want whitelists
//- There are so many resource kinds I can't keep track how to restrict everything, or even list
//    them; it will also fail open if a new resource kind is introduced
//- Many lockdown functions temporarily disable privileges, rather than completely delete them
//- There's little or no documentation on which privileges are required for the operations I need
//- The lockdown functions are often annoying to call, involving variable-width arrays in
//    structures, and LCIDs that likely vary between reboots
//And I cannot trust such a system. I only trust whitelists, like Linux seccomp.
//Even Chrome couldn't find anything comprehensive; they use everything they can find (restricted token, job object, desktop,
// SetProcessMitigationPolicy, firewall, etc), but some operations, such as accessing FAT32 volumes, still pass through.
//It feels like the Windows sandboxing functions are designed for trusted code operating on untrusted data, rather than untrusted code.
//Since I can't create satisfactory results in such an environment, I won't even try.
//
//The Linux implementation is, of course, secure. It has a solid whitelist mechanism (seccomp),
// denying access to creating any and all unauthorized resources - and even using authorized
// resources in an unauthorized way. I don't even need to drop privileges, it won't get a chance to
// use them.
//Documentation is also excellent; source code is available everywhere, all syscalls (both Linux-only and Unix-global)
// are well documented, and if I miss something, strace quickly tells me what.
//
//On Linux, this requires exclusive control over SIGSYS in the child process.
//All uses (according to <http://lxr.free-electrons.com/ident?i=SIGSYS>, kernel version 4.6) are either seccomp,
// hardware events on rare platforms that won't be delivered to me, or catching / passing on the signal (as opposed to raising it).
//Therefore, this requirement is safe.
