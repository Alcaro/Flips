# This script does nothing, other than trick people into running it and print the manual.
# Since configure is usually run before make, and people tend to read its output

To compile Floating IPS in release mode (recommended for most users; will take a
 few minutes, but result will be fast), use \`./make.sh'.
To compile Floating IPS in almost-release mode (2% slower at runtime, but only
 takes a few seconds to compile), use  \`./make.sh --profile=no'.
To compile Floating IPS in debug mode (NOT recommended unless you're tracking a
 bug, it's VERY slow for big files), use \`make'.
